## Features

### Progression with Points

Players earn points by completing a clean lap (without a cut or collision) and through bonuses. Each collision, pit re-entry, and invalid lap completion deducts points from the player. As players earn more points they unlock access to more cars, and as they reach a certain milestone in points they are assigned as convoy leaders (more on that below).

Earning points:

- Completing a clean lap
- Earning a point bonus (clean lap streak, convoys, etc.)

Point deductions:

- Each collision
- Reversing back into pits
- Completing an invalid lap

Available point bonuses:

- Completing a lap with a clean lap steak at 3 or higher
- Participating in and finishing a clean lap with a convoy
- Beating your personal best lap time
- Beating the best lap time record
- Earning points during double points weekend

### Convoys

Convoys allow all players on the server to follow 1 player (a convoy leader) and complete a lap with them to earn a big point bonus. Convoys can only be hosted by admins and/or players with a specific amount of points or more.

Note:

- To start a convoy, convoy leaders ideally pull up next to the ambulance near the pit exit. Once parked they run /cs. When the convoy leader starts driving, a message will be shown in the chat to let others know that the convoy is on the move.
- Convoy leaders should allow all other players in the convoy to finish the lap before them. The convoy leader should finish last, ideally staying right on the final straight and parking on the white concrete.
- Convoys can only conclude with a point bonus if there are 2 or more other players. For admins it can be 1 player.

### Variable Idle Kick

Players by default can idle for 15 minutes, after completing 5 clean laps they can idle for up to 60 minutes. There’s a fixed idle limit of 10 minutes in cars specified as “starter cars”.

### Announcements

Automated messages sent by the server at a specified interval.
